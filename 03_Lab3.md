# Lab 3

In this lab we will work with the very important FHIR concept of references.

## References in FHIR

References between resources in FHIR always go in one direction only. For example, observations have a reference to the corresponding subject to which the observation applies (e.g. a patient), but the patient has no references to any observations.

This is an optimization because when new observations are made, the patient does not need to be updated. The same applies, for example, to the relationship between doctor and patient: the patient has a reference to the doctor (general practitioner), but the doctor has no reference to his patients.

A resource's possible references can easily be identified in the documentation:
